    <h2>Using wall support in your tango practice</h2>
   
    <p>In my <a href="one_song_a_day.html" style="text-decoration: none; " target="_blank">previous article</a>, I shared a little plan for inspiring your personal tango practice ðŸ’« </p>
        
    <p> Following up on the importance of practicing alone, it's important to make sure that if you are practicing using high heels, that you are extra gentle with yourself.</p>

    <p>Practicing tango against a wall is a great way to start practicing individually when using high heels, for a number of reasons:</p>
    
    <h4>1. Avoiding too much weight in our heels</h4>
    <p>If all of a sudden we want to support all our weight in our heels, our ankles will suffer and we can cause an injury. The support of the wall makes it easier to practice without causing pain, since it mimics the support we get from the connection with a tango partner.</p>
    <h4>2. Improving our balance, gradually</h4>
    <p>The support from the wall helps us improve our balance in heels, which needs practice.</p>
    <h4>3. Keeping a nice posture</h4>
    <p>Looking at the wall helps align our spines correctly, ensuring our posture is upright and avoiding the tendency to look downwards while practicing alone.</p>
    <h4>4. Developing strength over time</h4>
    <p>While practicing on the wall we are training our core muscles, and over time we develop the necessary strength and balance for dancing independently with no support if we wish to.</p>      
    
    <p>For these reasons, using wall support when beginning to practice alone using high heels is a great idea. Also, make sure your floor is suitable for dancing and allows you to pivot with ease.</p>
    
    <p>Here is a short clip of my own practice - and you can see I'm also guilty of looking at the floor a little bit!</p>
