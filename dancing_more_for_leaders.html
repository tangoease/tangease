        <h2>How to dance more at Milongas: tips for leaders</h2>
    
    <p>One of the challenges for new tango dancers is getting to dance more at milongas (the social tango events). 
        Here are some tips that might help you secure more and better dances as a leader!</p>

    <h4>1. Appreciate Simple Tandas</h4>
    <p>Limiting yourself to only dance with the most experienced followers will limite your opportunities to dance and have fun. 
        Dancing with beginners and showing that you can enjoy dancing simply and nicely with the music will make you more popular 
        among all followers, including the experienced ones! Itâ€™s common that very experienced dancers will want to see you 
        dancing before accepting your invitation.</p>

    <h4>2. Good Navigation Skills</h4>
    <p>As a leader, if you don't navigate the dance floor well or don't follow basic tango etiquette, followers might avoid accepting 
        your dances. Improving these aspects will make you a better dancer, even when your dance skills are not super advanced.</p>

   <h4>3. Polishing Your Technique</h4>
    <p>Having good technique foundations and ensuring that your dance is comfortable for your partner is crucial in tango. Working 
        on your basics and having an elegant and comfortable walk, will make you a popular dancer!</p>

    <h4>4. Understanding Tango Music</h4>
    <p>Being musical when dancing will turn your dance into an art. Follower and leader are connected by the music, and the musicality 
        of the leader is essential for a beautiful dance that interprets the music in the moment.</p>
    
    <h4>5. Being Elegant</h4>
    <p>You don't need to wear super fancy clothes for tango, but your outfit should suggest that you are familiar with tango dancing, 
        and that you can move comfortably. Shoes are a key aspect of the dance, so make sure you have shoes that allow you to pivot 
        smoothly (ideally, tango shoes). And if you tend to sweat a lot when dancing, having an extra shirt to change into can be 
        very beneficial. Hygiene is very important when dancing in close embrace with a partner.</p>
        
    <h4>6. Mastering the Art of Cabeceo</h4>
    <p>This is a very tricky one. Itâ€™s good to have a clear cabeceo, but if it's too persistent it might scare followers away. Make 
        sure you are friendly and clear, but always subtle and respectful. And keep in mind that your invitation can be rejected 
        sometimes and itâ€™s never personal.</p>

    <p>Attending milongas as a beginner is a big step! I hope these tips are helpful, and I'm sure friends and teachers in your tango 
        community will be happy to share their insights with you as well, to help you get more dances.</p>


    <p>Happy dancing! ðŸŽ¶</p>
