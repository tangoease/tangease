        <h2>Practicing Tango in open embrace</h2>

        <p>I love the close embrace, it's something so unique to this dance! But when I first started dancing tango in 
            Mar del Plata in 2011, one of my teachers was an open embrace tango nuevo dancer. Practicing in open embrace 
            at lessons was very helpful for me, and here are some of the benefits that come to mind:</p>
    
        <h4>1. Strengthening Axis and Balance</h4>
        <p>In open embrace, both partners are encouraged to strengthen their own axis. This helps each dancer develop 
            balance and stability, which are essential skills in tango.</p>
    
        <h4>2. Comfort for Beginners</h4>
        <p>Open embrace can be more comfortable for beginners. It provides more personal space and can make the initial learning process less intimidating.</p>
    
        <h4>3. Differentiating Practicas from Milongas</h4>
        <p>Even if you love dancing in close embrace in milongas, dancing in open embrace at practicas can be helpful 
            because it differentiates practicing from dancing socially. In open embrace, you can also see the movements better, 
            which is great for practicing.</p>
    
        <h4>4. Softer Posture</h4>
        <p>The close embrace in tango is not symmetric, and it becomes even more asymmetric in very close embrace. 
            For followers, there are moments where the inner shoulder might end up slightly lifted to accommodate 
            the embrace. Switching to open embrace can give the partner a break and allow the shoulders to align properly again.</p>
    
        <h4>5. Flexibility to Suit Different Partners</h4>
        <p>Open embrace can be more suitable for some people. Leaders will notice that some followers clearly prefer an open embrace, so it's good to be flexible and capable of dancing at different levels of closeness.</p>
    
        <h4>6. Creativity</h4>
        <p>More space in the embrace allows for creativity! Some music calls for more expansive movements and a bigger dancing style. Open embrace provides the room to explore our creativity and musicality.</p>
    
        <p>Both close and open embrace have their unique purposes in Tango. Being able to dance in both styles 
            will make you a more versatile and creative dancer ðŸ’«</p>
    


    <p>Happy dancing! ðŸŽ¶</p>
