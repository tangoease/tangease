        <h2>Dancing in high heels: solo practice tips</h2>
       
        <p>In my <a href="one_song_a_day.html" class="border_hover_article" target="_blank">previous article</a>, I shared a little plan for inspiring your personal tango practice üí´ </p>
            
        <p> Following up, let's make sure that if you are practicing using high heels, you are extra gentle with yourself!</p>
            
        <h4>1. Happy Feet</h4>
        <p>High heels are beautiful for milongas and performances, but they can cause pain when practicing alone. Practice shoes with lower and wider heels can be found at an affordable price and will keep your feet happy and healthy.</p>
        <h4>2. Smooth Floor Surface</h4>
        <p>Hard floors and some carpets can make it very challenging to pivot. Make sure your floor is suitable for dancing and that you can pivot with ease without feeling pain in your ankles and knees.</p>
        <h4>3. Start by Practicing with Wall Support</h4>
        <p>If you are just starting practicing alone, and suddenly support all your weight on high heels, your ankles will suffer. The support of the wall will make it easier to practice alone comfortably.</p>
    
        <h4>4. Keeping a Nice Posture</h4>
        <p>Maintaining good posture and avoiding the tendency to look downwards when practicing alone will make your dancing so much more comfortable.</p>

    <p>Here is a short clip of my own practice  using wall support - and you can see that I'm also guilty of looking at the floor sometimes!</p>

            <iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/n2Ep5sX1hrA?si=HdZFVsOATpHLJCff" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe>
          </div>
    
        <h4>5. Be Patient</h4>
        <p>Getting to a point where you can dance solo in high heels comfortably takes a lot of time and practice. Be patient and think about your practice in baby steps. What really matters is feeling comfortable enough to enjoy tango and create something beautiful in each tanda üíù</p>      
                
        <p>Happy dancing! üé∂ </p>
